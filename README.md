#### Hi there, I'm David Santamaria!

Software engineer interested in software analysis, architecture and development. I've been mostly focused on Web. Love to build things with quality, from the conception to the deploy. I take the software that I write very seriously while having an extreme passion for being the best I can be at doing what I love to do.
Experience in leading and working with engineering teams in the architecture, specification and implementation of complex, highly scalable and performant systems.
